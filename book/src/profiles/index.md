# Color Management Profiles

ICC Color profiles in digital media describe color attributes of input and output devices,
and mapping device color coordinates to or from an absolute color space, such as the CIE XYZ
and CIELAB color spaces.

The [International Color Consortium](color.org) manages the specification of these color profiles
to  'promote the use and adoption of open, vendor-neutral, cross-platform color management systems';
it was formed in 1993.

There are three main specifications:

* [V2 ICC Profile Specification](https://www.color.org/ICC_Minor_Revision_for_Web.pdf), 
* [V4 ICC Profile Specification](https://www.color.org/specification/ICC1v43_2010-12.pdf),
* [V5.0.0 iccMax Profile Specification](https://www.color.org/specification/ICC.2-2019.pdf).
